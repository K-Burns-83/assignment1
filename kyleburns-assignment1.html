    <h1>Kyle Burns</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Took an HTML class in high school</li>
      <li>Learned mostly basic things most of which we have now gone over in this class</li>
      <li>Did some work with External CSS but not much</li>
    </ul>
    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!
